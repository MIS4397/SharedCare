Hello Everyone,
 <br>
Attached are the tables for the Dynamic SQL Opportunities.  Incidentally the Dynamic SQL Opportunity should not have a due date of Thursday, November 15 since I gave it out today as opposed to last Thursday.  If you turn it on in Tuesday, November 20, that will be just fine.  By the way, since my email is behaving erratically, I would appreciate it if you would let me know that you have received this message. 
 <br>
Thanks very much.
